## Events

You can listen to two events: 

- `ElementTaggingEvent` : This event is triggered  before a Pimcore element is tagged.
- `ElementInvalidationEvent` : This event is triggered before a Pimcore element is invalidated.

This allows you to add additional tags or cancel the tagging/invalidation process or just do your own stuff.
