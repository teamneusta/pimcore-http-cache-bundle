## Events

You have the possibility to listen to two events. This allows you to add additional tags or cancel the tagging/invalidation process or just do your own stuff. 

- `ElementTaggingEvent`: This event is triggered  before a Pimcore element is tagged.
- `ElementInvalidationEvent`: This event is triggered before a Pimcore element is invalidated.
